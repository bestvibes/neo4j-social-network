# neo4j-social-network
A simple social network I made using Neo4j, a graph database, and Flask in Python. You can create users who can connect over multiple popular mediums such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram.

It uses the 1.6.4 py2neo library to interface with the graph database (only tested with Neo4j version 2.0.2).

Most of the logic is in app/neo4j.py

Terminology:

mekid - the user identifier or username

konnect - connect
